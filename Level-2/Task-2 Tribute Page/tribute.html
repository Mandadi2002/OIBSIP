          <h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
          <p>
            <b>Ratan Tata</b>(born December 28, 1937, Bombay [now Mumbai], India—died October 9, 2024, Mumbai) was an Indian businessman
             who became chairman (1991–2012 and 2016–17) of the Tata Group, a Mumbai-based conglomerate.
              He was widely admired not only for his stewardship of one of the country’s largest conglomerates but also for his personal 
              ethics and philanthropic activities. Tata was regarded as a visionary leader, and his legacy is one of compassion and innovation that
              transcends the confines of the corporate realm to impact millions of ordinary lives. In his lifetime he received two of India’s highest 
              civilian honors—the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and the Padma Bhushan (2000).
